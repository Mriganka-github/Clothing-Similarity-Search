# Clothing-Similarity-Search

# The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of receiving text describing a clothing item and returning a ranked list of links to similar items from different websites. It accepts a text string and returns JSON responses with ranked suggestions.
# The model is deployed as a streamlit web application. It takes a string as input and returns top 10 recommended items.
